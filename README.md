A repository contains my implementation / plays with the popular dynamic data strucutres using C-programming Language .

### Why choosing C specfically ? 

C is considred as a low level programming language , due to it's features like pointers , dynamic memory allocation... so it's a great language to understand how things work under the hood , instead of using built-in abstract functions or libraries 😄

### Why implementing them ? 

Easy ! to understand them 

“What I cannot create, I do not understand.” – Richard Feynman
### Implementation details : 
[Linked-Lists](https://github.com/wassim31/C-Data-Structures/tree/master/Linked-lists)

I implemented : 

 size() - returns number of data elements in list 
 value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
 push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
 pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
 push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
 pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
 front() - get value of front item
 back() - get value of end item
 insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index
 erase(index) - removes node at given index
 value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at nth position from the end of the list
 reverse() - reverses the list
 remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value
 reverse() - reverse a linked-list
