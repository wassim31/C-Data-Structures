Array implementation of Stack data structure .

Stack data structure , also called as LIFO (Last in First out).

I implemented bunch of functions to manipulate the Stack.

push() : to add an element to the Stack.

Option : if we push a number of elements > stack.size , my solution was implementing memcpy(from scratch) , it took O(n) space complexity (we need to copy the actual_array into the new array).

pop() : to delete the element from the Stack.

Happy coding :smiley: !
