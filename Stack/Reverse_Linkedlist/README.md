### Reverse Linked list using Stack :smiley:

One of ways to reverse a linked list using another Abstract data type which the Stack (last in , first out)

this way is much expansive in memory.

Time complexity : O(n) // same as the iterative way (modifying the links)

Space complexity : O(n) // We're using a Stack of size Linked-list.size.

### Happy Coding :smiley:
